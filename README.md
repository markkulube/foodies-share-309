The web app is a social-media style interaction-based feed that revolves around users posting recipes, searching for recipes, rating/commenting on recipes and saving recipes.

### Posting a Recipe
Users can post their own unique recipes to the timeline with a title, description, category, ingredients and instructions. To do this, a user just has to click the "Post a Recipe" button on the main timeline and they will be redirected to another page where they can input their information for a recipe. Note: please put comments between instruction steps and ingredients (ex. 1 egg, 1 cup cocoa, etc)  

After you press the "Post it on Foodies" button, the recipe will be posted on the main timeline and will redirect you back to the main timeline as well.

### Search Bar
Users can search for specific recipes on the timeline using keywords and the timeline will update according to the keywords/characters typed in.

### Recipe Category Pages
Similar to Twitterâ€™s side navigation bar, users can look for a category of recipes like Dinner, Dessert, Breakfast, etc. All the user has to do is click a button corresponding to a category and the timeline will update accordingly.

### My Posts page
USers can view their own recipes that they've created along with any posts that they have saved. Users can view these recipes by clicking the "My Posts" button on the side, which will redirect them to the UserTimeline page.

### Save a Recipe Post

# Features of Web Application (Admin)
Admin's have access to the same functionality as users, but they also have access to the "Admin" page where they can edit and view accounts as well as their posts.

### Search for users

### Review posts on a user's timeline
Admins can review posts on a specific user's timeline, including their posts and saved posts. However, they will review posts as if they are the user, not the admin. This means the review will be from the user they are viewing.

### Search/Delete Posts
